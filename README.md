   Copy and paste the following command into the terminal and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; `
   [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = `
   [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; `
   iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Spotube requires API credentials to connect with Spotify and YouTube.  
On the first run, it will create a `config.json` file that you'll need to configure through the Settings dialog.

4. Check the Developer Terms of Service and click **Create**.
5. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
6. Enter these details in the Spotube app's settings.

### YouTube Data API Key Setup

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Create a new project (click on the project dropdown at the top ‚Üí **New Project**).
